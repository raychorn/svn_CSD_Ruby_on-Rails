This application has an intended use of providing a way to help people who need
the services of an ASL ( American Sign Language ) interpreter.  It allows clients
to search for interpreters in their area and attempts to bring possible matching
interpreters to the aid of the client or deaf person.  This includes scheduling
and payment for the interpreter.
